# Priisvergliich

Priisvergliich ("Price comparison" in English) is an app that allows the user to search and compare items in Swiss supermarkets. The app is inspired from the popular (but unfortunately now no longer) mysupermarket.co.uk. 

Some of the features will include but are not limited to:

* Price comparison - query and find out which Swiss supermarkets sell the item/s you're looking for the cheapest price
* Optimal shopping algorithm - based on an input of items, find out which shop you should go to in order to save the most money
* Rating system - allows the user to rate particular products (star system + comments)
* Receipt scanning - Automatically add items from a receipt into the app for later purposes
