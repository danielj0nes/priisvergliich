# Priisvergliich

Priisvergliich ("Price comparison" in English) is an app that allows the user to search and compare items across Swiss supermarkets. The app is inspired from the popular (but unfortunately now no longer) mysupermarket.co.uk.

The current list of features are:

* Product comparison - query and find out which Swiss supermarkets sell the item/s you want for the cheapest price

* Optimal shopping algorithm - based on an input of items, find out which shop you should go to in order to save the most money
