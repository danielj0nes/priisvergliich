# Priisvergliich

Priisvergliich ("Price comparison" in English) is an app that allows the user to search and compare items across Swiss supermarkets. The app is inspired from the popular (but unfortunately now no longer) mysupermarket.co.uk. 

Some of the features will include but are not limited to:

* Product comparison - query and find out which Swiss supermarkets sell the item/s you want for the cheapest price **done**
* Optimal shopping algorithm - based on an input of items, find out which shop you should go to in order to save the most money **in progress**
* Rating system - allows the user to rate particular products (star system + comments) **probably won't do**
* Receipt scanning - Automatically add items from a receipt into the app for later purposes **will attempt**
* Location - find nearest shops and factor this (and different information) in to the calculations. **will attempt differently - store locator instead**
